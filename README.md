Serum Cholesterol: Cholesterol level in the blood
Fasting Blood Sugar: Blood sugar level after fasting
Resting ECG Results: Results of a resting electrocardiogram
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate during exercise
Exercise Induced Angina: Whether exercise induced angina was present
ST Depression: ST-segment depression induced by exercise
Slope of ST Segment: Slope of the ST segment during exercise
Number of Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: Number of vessels visualized by fluoroscopy
Thal: Thalassemia diagnosis
Target: Presence or absence of heart disease
Methodology
Data Exploration:

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify missing values, and check for outliers.
Visualize the data using appropriate plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to gain insights into relationships between features and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values using techniques like imputation or removal.
Normalize numerical features to ensure they have a similar scale.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Selection and Training:

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to find the most suitable model for this task.
Train the selected model on the training set using appropriate hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Â  
Assess the model's ability to predict heart attacks accurately.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
Use techniques like grid search or random search to explore different parameter combinations.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to a production environment for real-time predictions.
